The window was unlocked!  Even better, Mitch didn't recognize this
part of the complex at all.  It might be the right place.

He had to reach over his head to slide the window open.  He grabbed
the sill and started to pull himself up.  His feet kicked
ineffectually against the wall while his gut pushed him away from it,
making the angle awkward.

Someone inside opened the window the rest of the way.  Strong hands,
younger than his by a good decade or two, reached out to help pull him
in.  Mitch grit his teeth and kicked against the wall harder.  He got
one armpit over the top, then another, and then all of a sudden he was
toppling over into the room.

He sprawled onto his stomach, slapping his hands into the ground like
he'd learned back when he did fieldwork.  His arm felt like it had
been wrenched out of its socket.  His glasses were fogged from heavy
breathing in the cold air.  All he could see was two pairs of feet,
one in a large pair of nice dockers, the other in a pair of maroon
heels.

"Mitch?" asked an older woman's voice above him.  "Or Bob?"

Mitch rolled his shoulder.  It was fine.  He pushed himself to his
feet, wincing a little, and took off his glasses to polish them.
"Mitch," he said, rubbing his lenses on the corner of his sweater.
"Mitch Mandel."

He put his glasses back on, and the room snapped into focus.  It was a
mess.  Not an "untidy" sort of mess, although it was untidy, but a
"something is wrong here" sort of mess.

The drywall was a wreck, missing in some places, scraped or scratched
or filled with holes in others.  A chair was wedged under the door
handle of the only exit.  One corner looked to be a makeshift sleeping
area.  There was a pile of junk in another, covered in dust.
*Nothing* in the complex should be covered in dust.  The carpet was
filled with hair and detritus, like it hadn't been vacuumed in
forever.

There was a square table, with four chairs around it.  It was covered
in messy piles of paper.  Behind it was a whiteboard that was getting
on in years, streaks and smears of color left behind after erasing it
too many times.

The woman coughed.  It was like a librarian's cough.  Mitch stood a
little straighter, turning to look at her.  She was holding out a
slightly-wrinkly hand covered in rings.  "Barb Streiss," she said.
Mitch shook her hand, looking her over.  She was in her 60s, maybe,
well-dressed but a little overenthusiastic with the jewelry.  She had
horn-rim glasses and a pinched face, but her eyes were bright.

"You're late," she said, turning and walking back to the table.

"Erm," Mitch responded cleverly.  He wasn't sure how he could be late
when she didn't even know who he was.  Instead he turned to the other
person in the room, a tall 20-something in a suit, with hands in his
pockets.

The man inclined his chin.  "Bernie Stein," he said.  His voice was
deep, and he was built more like a linebacker than a desk jockey.
Mitch returned the raised chin.

Barb had settled back into a seat, in front of the largest pile of
papers.  "So," she said, clicking open a pen, "what do you remember?"

---

"I remember a lot," Mitch said.  Barb wrote while he spoke, not
looking up.  "Well, I guess it feels like a lot.  I remember that I
work *here*, in the visual memetics department--"

"Not for three years," Barb interrupted.  She kept writing while
Mitch gaped.  "You were re-assigned to antimemetics three years ago.
You worked under Bob."

Mitch snorted.  "Antimemetics?  That's dead-end nonsense.  Nobody's
ever...found...an antimeme..."  Mitch trailed off.

Bernie coughed.  "Why don't you start from the beginning," he said.
"Where did you wake up?"

"In a motel room."

"Why did you come here?"

"Well, because I work here.  I overslept, so I ran right out the door.
I knew something had happened when my ID didn't work.  The security
guard didn't recognize me, either.  Nobody did."

Mitch took out his ID.  The lamination on it was failing, and it had
expired over a year go.  "What the hell is going on?" he asked.

"Later," Barb responded.  "I need to debrief you first.  It's in
the document."

"The what?"

Barb stopped writing, peering at Mitch over the top of her glasses.
He rolled his eyes.  "Fine.  After security threw me out, I tried
calling my sister, but she didn't pick up.  Then I tried calling my
old officemate, but he didn't know who I was.  I realized something
was affecting people's memories.  Then I realized something was
affecting *my* memory.  I couldn't remember what I'd done yesterday,
or the day before.  So naturally I hopped the fence and started trying
to find a part of the complex I didn't remember..."

---

The debrief took about half an hour.  By the end, Mitch was starting
to piece together what had happened.

"So," he said, in a conversational tone of voice.  "We're infected?"
A normal person might have been freaking out.  But Mitch had worked at
the complex his entire career.  He'd been in worse scrapes.

"*Everyone* is infected," Barb corrected him.  "We're just the
loci.  That's why nobody can remember us."

"A real-life antimeme," Mitch mused.  "Just my luck.  I change
departments just in time for antimemetics to finally find something."

Barb looked at him like he was the stupidest man in the world.
Mitch scratched his chin.

Bernie's watch beeped.  He glanced at it, then looked up at Barb.
"2:00 PM."

Barb began shuffling papers.  "Good.  We're only a little behind
schedule.  I'll start--"

"Wait a second," Mitch interrupted.  "I still have some questions."

Barb shoved a three-ring binder across the table to him.  The cover
was labeled with heavy block lettering: **Answers to Mitch's
Questions**.

Mitch shrugged and flipped it open.  It did, in fact, contain the
answers to the questions he was about to ask, in roughly the order
he'd been planning to ask them.

```
> What is this binder?

You ask the same questions every day, so you wrote down
these answers for yourself.

> What's the document Barb was talking about?

The antimemetic event occurs every 23-25 hours at midnight
pacific.  The event erases all memories related to the four
of us.  The document is a written set of facts and
instructions that allows us to act across the event
boundary.

> Every 23-25 hours at midnight?  The event respects
> daylight savings time?

Yes.  We believe it is somehow entangled with human
cognition.

> You said the four of us?

*Bob hasn't shown up in a long time.  The document is vague
 on him.

> If written records of the four of us persist through the
> event...

That's not a question.  But, yes.  Records of us exist.
The complex currently believes that the four of us are
mythomemetic in nature.  Like slender man on steroids.

> They think that there's a mythomeme presenting as four
> members of the antimemetics division that nobody
> remembers?

Yes.  The complex finds new mythomemes every day, and
antimemes are entirely theoretical to everyone outside this
room.

> Why can I remember working here, but not what happened
> yesterday?

The event affects information related to the four of us, in
proportion to the degree of that relation.  You spent all
yesterday with 2-3 event loci, but for most of your career
you didn't even know them.

> Why did I wake up in a motel?  Why am I the last one
> here?

Being awake during the antimemetic event is traumatic.  We
sleep through it.  You react poorly to waking up in a room
full of strangers, so you sleep in a motel.  You also react
poorly to waking up with a set of instructions you don't
remember writing.  It's better to let you find your own way
here.

Barb sleeps in this room, and Bernie writes himself a note
every night that takes him straight here.
```

Mitch paused.  That answer seemed a little suspicious.  Surely waking
up alone in a motel room wasn't the optimal way to get him here.  He
flipped the page, chewing on that thought.

```
> This is all very suspicious.

Also not a question.  But yes.  You're a paranoid bastard
Mitch.  Your colleagues find it very frustrating, but it's
kept you alive so far.  I say hold onto it.
```

He paused again to consider that.  The shoe fit, he couldn't deny it.
He imagined waking up with a note explaining all of this.  He would've
smelled a rat and hopped on a plane to Tahiti.

He started flipping through the binder.  After the first three pages,
every other page was a big drawing of an angry face.  He stopped on
one of the angry faces and read the text below it.

```
>:(

Stop flipping through the damn binder!  I put these in
order for a reason.
```

He ignored the text, of course, and turned the page again.  He was
close to the end.

```
> What if it *isn't* an antimeme?  Maybe everyone "forgot"
> me because I never worked at the complex at all.  Maybe

Your memories are patchy.  Any meme that can edit your
memories might as well be an antimeme.

---

Almost an hour later, Mitch looked up from his binder.  Bernie shifted
a little in his chair, eyeing him.  "2:40," he said, checking his
watch again.  Barb made a noise of acknowledgment.

"The document says you should now be suspicious that we are working
against you," she said, not taking her eyes off the papers in front of
her.

Mitch coughed.  "Well," he said.  "Are you?"

Bernie took a little cue card from his pocket and read from it.  "If
we were, I would have just shot you."  He lifted the hem of his sport
coat to show the black polymer handle of a gun.

Mitch nodded.  "So even if you are working against me, you at least
need something from me," he offered easily.  "Is there any food around
here?  Or wait, coffee.  I could kill for a cup of coffee."

Barb stopped reading to dig around in her purse.  She tossed him an
energy bar and a warm coldbrew.  "Bernie steals those from the vending
machine after people go home for the night," she said.  "It's not a
good idea to wander around the compound when nobody remembers you.
Eat fast; we're behind schedule."

Mitch shoved half the energy bar in his mouth.  "What's the schedule?"
he asked, in-between chews.  It was chocolate peanut butter.  His
favorite.

"I wake up at 6.  One hour to orient myself and address concerns.  I
review the document from 7-11, Bernie arrives around 8:30 and assists.
Lunch until 11:30, then we work on whatever the document has assigned
us until you arrive between 11:30 and 13:00.  We try to have you
oriented by 13:30.  We work on our assigned tasks until 19:00.  You
continue working while I update the document and Bernie goes out to
steal us supplies.  When Bernie gets back, usually around 21:00, you
two go off to sleep in motels, and I sleep here."

Mitch took a swig of the warm coldbrew.  He winced at the taste.
"That's a lot of time spent on the document."

"It's a complicated document.  We've tried a lot of things."

"Have you considered that the document may be a trap?"

"It's my writing."

"Maybe the *first* version of the document was a trap, written by this
Bob character, and you've updated it enough that--"

"Mitch," Bernie interrupted.  "We've thought it through.  Eat your
damn energy bar."

Mitch held up his hands.  He didn't stop thinking about it, though.
The question was one of motivation.  Maybe someone was very invested
in all three of them being asleep at midnight, but needed them
alive.  He took another bite of his energy bar.

---

Working on the document was surprisingly boring.  Mitch smiled and
helped out as much as he could, while his mind began to pick the
problem apart from other angles.

The document's current angle of attack was to try and draw more people
into the antimemetic effect, to increase their manpower.  The
document's working theory was that the four of them were loci of the
antimeme because they knew there *was* an antimeme.  So if they could
convince someone else, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the antimeme
was real, then that person might get drawn in too.

What tended to happen instead was that people listened to their story,
promised to help, then woke up the next morning remembering nothing.
Sometimes these people left themselves clues, hints that "The
Antimemetic Four" were real, in which case they checked themselves
into infohazard observation, and that was that.

But they were only a few dozen loops into the current plan.  There
were a lot more approaches to try.  They started brainstorming, while
Mitch worked on his pet theory.

"Hey, Barb," he said.  "Could I see my binder for a second?"

She didn't even look up.  "Not while you're holding a pen."

"Why not?  I thought I wrote it."

"You did.  But the document says that you try to leave yourself
cryptic clues in it, so any edits have to be carefully checked and
rewritten by myself.  We aren't scheduled for that until later this
week."

"Couldn't I just write myself notes at home, though?"

"You do sometimes.  You usually hop on a plane to Russia when you wake
up, and we don't see you for a few days.  You find your way back
eventually, but we lose a lot of time, so I would prefer you not do
this."

Mitch frowned.  Why Russia?  He'd hated Russia since he'd been
stationed there in 1990.  Maybe that made sense, though; it was the
last place he would expect himself to go.  Was he really so
ironically predictable?

He felt through his pockets for papers.  Nothing.  That was very
strange.  He felt like he would've at least tried to leave himself
cryptic clues that wouldn't spook him when he woke up, but would be
easy to find once he knew what was going on.  Maybe if he went back to
the motel room he'd find something.

---

By the time things were wrapping up, Mitch had narrowed the situation
down to 2.5 likely possibilities.  None of those possibilities
benefited from being shared.  When the time came, he shook hands
firmly with Barb and Bernie, promised not to write himself any
messages that sent him off to Russia, and made his ungainly escape out
the window.

The walk back to the motel was dark and cold.  He should've thought to
bring a jacket this morning.  The motel clerk was unsurprised to see
him back, since he'd abandoned all his things, and happily booked him
another night.  Mitch paid for his room in wrinkled 20s that Bernie
stole from the canteen cash register every night.

He spent ten minutes searching his room for secret messages.  There
was nothing.  Eventually he shrugged and sat down on the bed, pulling
the blankets over his head.

Alone under the blanket with only the light of his phone, he dug
around in his pocket until he came up with a quarter.  He couldn't
leave himself notes for whatever reason.  It wasn't so much that
Barb had told him not to, it was the fact that he hadn't found any
today.  That meant it wasn't a stable strategy.  With notes he
couldn't try things in serial, but there was always random chance.

He only had a few plausible plans.  It didn't take many coin flips to
pick one.  When the last flip fell tails he grimaced.  His binder had
gone to *extensive* lengths to convey to him just how unpleasant it
was to be awake at midnight.  Unpleasant, but not lethal, or he would
certainly be dead by now.  What sort of self-respecting agent wouldn't
wait up to see what happened?  He must have done it dozens of times.

So he pulled the blankets down, changed out of his suit, and sat up in
bed to wait.

---

At the stroke of midnight, he heard a sound from his door.  A key
turned in the lock.  He tensed, involuntarily, but tried to make
himself relax.  This was by far the best of the possible outcomes.

The door opened, and a man stepped through.  He was tall and dressed
in a nice suit with a distinctive bowler hat.  Mitch didn't recognize
him at all.  Mitch smiled, folding his arms and trying not to show
that his heart was racing.  "Hello, Bob," he said.

The man tipped his hat.  "Mitch," he said.  "My men told me you didn't
try to buy a weapon.  Is this the cooperative, I've-figured-it-out
sort of waiting up for me, then?"

Mitch shrugged.  "The random sort of waiting up for you."

The man cursed under his breath.  "Well," he said, stepping fully into
the room.  "Let's get on with it.  It's a lot easier when you're
asleep, you know."

A stream of men filed into the room behind him, all of them dressed in
suits and wearing ski masks.  Some of them carried fancy-looking
equipment.  Mitch quirked an eyebrow.

"I know I'm going to forget everything in a moment," he said, "but I
have to ask.  The curiosity is killing me."

Bob sighed.  He dragged out motel room's single chair and sat on it
backward, crossing his arms over the top.  "We have ten minutes while
my men set up.  I'll trade you.  What gave it away?"

Mitch thought back on events.  How easily he'd broken in to the
complex.  The dust-covered warroom that had never been repurposed.
The fact that he'd supposedly flown off to Russia multiple times, but
never gotten caught in a stable loop that kept him away.  The fact
that he'd booked a second night at this motel, but that it was only
the second night, rather than the hundredth.  The fact that whatever
stable loop he *was* in didn't include any kind of message to himself.
"Everything," he finally said.  "You really bit off a lot for
yourself."

Bob shrugged.  "When the program fails, it fails safe.  We just have
to start up again.  What *have* you figured out?  I'll explain the
rest if you walk me through your thought process."

"Well," Mitch said.  "I didn't think it was an antimeme.  I wasn't
sure until you walked in, but I didn't think so.  Too many things
didn't add up.  Even so, *something* was affecting my memory, and the
memory of everyone around me.  I started to think about who or what
could have the disposition of force to mess with everyone in the
complex like that.  But then I realized I was making assumptions.  I
*knew* that something was affecting my memory.  But what if everyone
else was just lying?"

Mitch readjusted on the bed.  The men around him were assembling their
gear into a rather menacing machine.  "Anyway, after that, a bunch of
stuff fell into place.  The complex would be at the top of my list for
people with access to technology that could modify my memory.  It
would be significantly easier to modify 1-3 people's memories than to
modify *everyone's* memories.  Everything pointed to the complex being
behind it.  It also explained that asinine 'records of you persist but
are mistaken for a mythomemetic hazard' story.  I don't know you, but
I assume that's not your best work."

Bob nodded along.  "Five minutes," he said, checking his watch.

"I'll ask my questions then.  Are Barb and Bernie in on it?"

"No.  We wipe them every night.  They're a lot less trouble than you
are, though."

"Why us?"

"You all volunteered.  Standard team.  A disposable field agent, a
paranoid asshole who's survived too much, and an adult to do the
actual work."

"*Why?*"

Bob checked his watch again.  "The antimemetics department has never
found an antimeme.  Not once.  They're theoretically possible, so--"

"Have you actually never found one?" Mitch interjected.  "Or do you just
not remember?"

"Exactly.  We've been working for years on a set of procedures that
would allow an individual or a small team that encountered an antimeme
to study it.  But we ran into a problem: how could we make sure these
procedures worked without an antimeme to test on?"

Mitch almost smacked his forehead.  Of course.  If you find yourself
in a strange situation, and you suspect an adversary arranged it, but
you don't know what they want, how do you start to reason about it?  A
hell of a good first guess is that they want whatever is going on.  If
you find yourself sitting in an office working on a document after
hundreds of amnesia loops -- well, they probably wanted you to work on
that document.

The men around Mitch were done with the machine.  It had a helmet that
looked suspiciously like an upside-down colander, and too many
blinking lights.

"One last question," Mitch said.  "How do you wipe my memory?"

Bob motioned with his hand, and the men around Mitch lowered the
col-lander onto his head.  Bob reached into his sport coat and produced
a stack of glossy photos.

"Neuronal hyperactivity.  Same mechanism as Alzheimer's, but we use
electricity.  We visually stimulate the connections we want to
disrupt, then use this machine here to produce a microtargeted
seizure."

Bob fanned out the photos.  There was a picture of Barb,
and Bernie, alongside a few others Mitch didn't recognize.
Two of the pictures were children.

"Don't worry," Bob said, "you're divorced.  But these are the memories
you'll be forgetting.  The human brain is a social organ.  It likes to
index memories by the people who were there, with a recency bias.
Please stare very intently at these photos, as well as my face.  We're
going to--"

Bob heard a beep from the machine, and then the world went white.
