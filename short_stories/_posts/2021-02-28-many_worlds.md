title: Many Worlds
---

It was early in the morning.  Far too early for Everett's liking, but
his body felt light and his mind felt sharp.  Today was the day he
learned the nature of the universe, and that sort of thing tended to
wake you up.

He sat in the lotus position, as he had been taught, studying the
world around him while he waited for his master.  He took his lessons
in a small forest glade.  The grass was soft, and long enough to
tickle his bare toes when he curled them.  It was a little wet.
Sunlight speared through the loose canopy around him, visible as
shifting golden beams in the early morning mist.

It was beautiful, but Everett found it difficult to care.  Far more
interesting were the tools arranged in front of him.  There were three
wax tablets, each blank, and behind them three clay cups.  Each cup
held a bundle of dried leaves.  There was no stylus for the tablets,
but he carried his own, one of the three tools which belonged only to
him.

Everett heard his master's approach before he saw him.  Quiet, steady
footsteps heralded the old man's arrival.  He emerged from a different
path than Everett had traveled, appearing suddenly like a deer from
the forest.

Everett's master was a severe man.  His frame was frail, his hair
gray, and his eyes milky white from some unknown affliction.  But he
carried himself with a strength greater than physical, the effortless
presence of the powerful.  He sat in front of Everett without a word,
his white robes settling around him.

He had brought his granddaughter today.  She was young, but not quite
a child, with long hair just a shade darker than her charcoal robes.
She trailed behind her grandfather like a shadow.  Today she carried a
ceramic jug wrapped in a small quilt.  Everett knew from experience it
carried boiling water.

His master gestured, and the girl stepped forward.  She gave Everett a
shy smile, making eye contact just for a moment, and poured from her
jug into the first cup on his left.

Everett's master spoke as she poured.  He wasted no time on greetings
or pleasantries.  Three years as his student, and Everett knew almost
nothing about him.

"A planning parable," his master said, his voice deep and steady
despite his age.  Everett sharpened his ears.

The girl finished filling his cup, and Everett dismissed her with a
shallow nod as he began to ponder.  A "planning parable" meant that
the men were allowed to make plans ahead of time, so they could follow
a joint strategy.  But in this case the question made no sense.  Each
was simply guessing at a coinflip, weren't they?  Perhaps that was
the point?  To quickly recognize that no strategy could help?

If he took too long to answer, his tea would grow cold.  "It doesn't
matter," he said decisively.  "The two coinflips are unrelated.  They
cannot do better than chance.  If both guess heads, for example, each
has a 1/2 chance of being right, so they have a 1/4 chance of both
being right."

His master stroked his short, whispy beard.  His expression was
unreadable.  After a moment, he spoke.  "What if instead, they were
asked to guess whether or not their coinflips matched?"

Everett's eyes darted to the side as he considered.  That one was also
easy.

"Either their coinflips match, or they don't," Everett said
confidently, "So if they both always guessed 'yes', then they would
both be right 1/2 the time.  I don't believe you can do any better."

His master nodded.  "Do you see?" he asked.  Everett's brow slowly
wrinkled.  He *did* see.  Hm.

The two questions were really the same question.  If you knew your own
coinflip, and you correctly guess whether the coinflips matched, then
you had correctly guessed the other coinflip.

Could that possibly work?  He considered the first question again.
If both men looked at their coin, and guessed that the other's had
flipped the same way...yes, it worked.

But that made no sense.  Their coinflips were unrelated.  If the men
couldn't see their own coinflip, he was *sure* they couldn't both
guess correctly more than 1/4 of the time.  How could it be that
seeing their own coinflip let them both guess correctly 1/2 the time,
when they were guessing at an unrelated event?  He checked, again and
again, and kept getting the same result.

"I see that you have understood the parable," his master said.  "You
may drink from the first cup."

It took effort for Everett to emerge from his thoughts.  He could
ponder the mystery more deeply later.  He reached for the cup on his
far left, which sat steaming while he thought.  It contained two dark
green leaves.  They had bloomed in the hot water, until they obscured
it from view.

He drank, tilting his head back, and it was bitter.  It tasted like no
tea he'd ever had before.  He set down the empty cup with a grimmace
to see that the girl was already filling his second cup.

The wax tablets sat on the ground, untouched.  Perhaps he should have
made use of one of them?  But despite his failure, the problem was
simple; he couldn't see the point in writing it down.

He was confused how these puzzles were meant to teach him the nature
of the universe.  But his master began to speak again, and he emptied
his mind to listen.

Everett saw the connection immediately.  This one seemed less tricky,
even if it was more complicated.  It was obvious how a strategy could
help, unlike the first one where it seemed impossible to do better
than chance.

There weren't that many strategies to try.  Each subject got to see 2
coinflips, then answer one of 3 ways.  There were only 3^(2^2)=81
different possible rules they could follow.  Perhaps different
subjects needed to follow different rules to do as well as they could,
but usually in planning parables everyone behaved the same way.

Everett started running through the 81 strategies in his head, then
realized his foolishness.  He deftly flicked his stylus from the
sleeve of his dark gray robe, and scooped up the second wax tablet
from the ground.  It was damp from the morning dew, but the wax was
soft and pliable as he began to shape it.

His tea grew cold as his master waited patiently.  He enumerated all
81 strategies, calculating their chance of winning the treasure as he
went.  His head was buzzing, and his fingers shook with nervous energy
as he worked.  There must have been something in that first cup of
tea.

Finally, he answered.  There were several strategies which were all
equally good, but one stood out as easy to explain.  "It is simple,
master.  Each subject, if told that the other two coinflips match,
guesses the opposite, and otherwise passes."

"Be more precise," his master said sternly.

Everett considered his words.  "If a subject is presented with two
heads, they should guess tails for their own coinflip.  If presented
with two tails, they should guess heads.  Otherwise they should pass.
The chance of winning is 3/4."  Everett was surprised the chance of
winning was so high.

His master thought for a moment, then nodded.  "I see.  And can you
explain why this is so?"

"It simply is, master.  There are only so many ways to play.  That is
the best of them."

His master shook his head.  "Then you do not yet understand.  But soon
you will.  You may drink from the second cup."

Everett put down his wax tablet and drank from the second cup.  This
one held three pale green leaves, and tasted sweet.  He was sorry he'd
let it grow cold.

"Now," his master said, the tiniest hint of amusement audible in his
voice, "the third and final planning parable."

Everett winced.  That was far too many different rules to try all of
them.

He was no neophyte, however.  He knew the way of things with planning
parables.  He picked up the third wax tablet, and before turning his
mind to the true challange, began to ponder the same parable with only
4 subjects.  There would most likely be a pattern.

The girl filled his third cup as he worked.  He barely noticed,
engrossed in his efforts.  Soon he had filled his wax tablet.  He had
smeared and re-used all the space he could, so he reached for the
other two.  His master said nothing as he spread his work across all
three surfaces.

The second cup of tea began to do its work as well.  His fingers
ceased to shake, his movements growing precise even as they kept their
nervous speed.  The buzzing in his head faded.  He was left with an
immense clarity.  He felt as though his mind was skating over vast
frozen rivers of thought.

No matter what he tried, though, he was unable to make the parable
yield.  He could generalize the pattern from three, but was that the
best he could do?  Without enumerating them all, how was he to know?

The glade faded from his perception as his focus intensified.  His
eagerness to learn the nature of the universe was long forgotten at
this point.  All that remained was a desire to resolve the parable.
His world shrunk to encompass only his hands, his eyes, and the three
tablets.

What felt like mere moments later, his master's voice dispersed his
focus.  "You may drink from the third cup."

Everett blinked, startled rudely back into reality.  The sun was high
above him now, burning the back of his neck from above the treetops.
His master had not moved, but his granddaughter was no longer with
them.  Everett hadn't even noticed her leave.

"Master?" he asked.  He had not yet solved the third parable.

"You have understood the shape of the parable, if not its solution.
You are ready to learn the nature of the universe."

Right.  That was why he had come here today.  Everett leaned forward
and grasped the third cup.  The leaves inside had dissolved, producing
a green liquid so dark it was almost black.  He tilted his head back
and drank.  The dark tea was cold as it slid down his throat.

The new liquid reacted violently with the contents of his stomach.
Everett doubled over, the cup half-finished, clutching his abdomen as
the contents began to bubble and roil.  His hands clenched.  Sweat
began to roll down his neck, and then his forehead, stinging his eyes.

The violent bubbling feeling spread through his body, until even his
fingertips felt like they were fizzing.  His brain jumped around like
the lid of an overboiled pot.  The clarity from before was shattered,
shards of his attention darting all over the glade, unable to form a
coherent thought.

He was going to throw up.  Or was he?

The world split in two.

In one world, Everett retched.  Thick green liquid and chunks of his
breakfast soaked the pristine grass.  He fell to his side as his whole
whole body relaxed, free of the poison.  His mind quieted.  His
thoughts returning to a single track: failure.

In the other, the liquid stayed down.  The strange feelings
intensified.  His mind grew more and more scattered, and his panicking
body began to feel far away.  He was going insane.

Everett felt a light touch on his forehead.  The first world
dissolved, and he was left in the second, except that his master had
stood and was pressing the back of a hand to his brow.

"Focus," his master said.  "Consider the first parable."

Everett complied, repeating the parable to himself.

> Every year Lord Midas summons 2 of his subjects to court.  They are
> taken to separate rooms, and each made to flip a coin.  They are
> then asked to guess whether the other man flipped heads.  If they
> are both right, they both go gome with a treasure.  What should they

He saw the parable in his mind's eye, the two men standing in separate
rooms, each flipping a coin.  They both flipped, and the world split
into 4.  Then, in each of the 4 worlds, they wrote down their guesses
according to the strategy he had found.

Everett saw it.  He saw it!  He grabbed a tablet in the real world, he
wasn't sure which one.  He smudged his existing work off with the back
of his hand like a neophyte, and began to write.

```
BEST STRATEGY:
Flip H -> Guess H
Flip T -> Guess T

FLIPS GUESSES SUCCESS PAYOFF
H H   H H     1 1     1
H T   T H     0 0     0
T H   H T     0 0     1
T T   T T     1 1     0
```

The two men were always both right, or both wrong.  If he compared it
to the naive solution of both men always guessing heads...

```
FIXED STRATEGY

FLIPS GUESSES SUCCESS PAYOFF
H H   H H     1 1     1
H T   H H     1 0     0
T H   H H     0 1     0
T T   H H     0 0     0
```

That was the secret, then.  Comprehension bloomed in his mind.  It was
true that since the two coinflips were unconnected, neither man could
guess correctly more than 1/2 the time.  If their guesses were
unrelated, they would both be right 1/4 the time.

But they could force their guesses to be related by looking at their
own coin.  No rule of the universe said they couldn't.  The number of
correct and incorrect guesses were the same, taken across all worlds
-- the number of 1s and 0s in the success column must always be equal
-- but they could be *moved between worlds* by different strategies.
Since the two men only got paid if they were both right, lining the 1s
up like pictures on a slot machine paid off.

---

Everett, excited, moved on to the second parable.  This one had 8
worlds, enough to strain his mind, but he persisted.  He repeated the
parable to himself and began to write.

Others Flip T T -> Guess H

It was beautiful.  Once again, no individual subject could be right
more than half the time.  The number of 1s and 0s in the success
column were equal.  But they could *pass*, and so they could arrange
all the 0s in the same world, and make sure each other world had
exactly one 1.  Since they got paid off if at least one man was right
and none were wrong, they could win in 6/8 worlds!

Everett was enlightened.  It generalized so cleanly onto the case of 7
prisoners.  He just had to figure out how to concentrate 7 wrong
guesses into the bad worlds, while having 1 correct guess in each of
the good worlds.  If it worked, the payoff rate would be 7/8.  With 3
prisoners, it had only been 3/4!  Somehow adding more prisoners made
the task *easier*!

Everett smiled, feeling the sun on his face, the wind on his hair.  A
moment later he vomited.

It was as worse than it had been in his imagined world.  His stomach
contracted, over and over, like the fist of god squeezing him dry.
Black-green goop mixed with fragments of leaf coated the glade.  He
just barely managed to avoid getting any on his robes.

"Good," his master said, his voice warm.  He had retreated a step just
before Everett retched.  "You have comprehended the nature of the
universe."  His master turned to leave, while Everett struggled to
collect himself.

Everett pushed himself up into a more dignified position, coughing the
last bits of liquid out of his throat.  He had certainly understood
*something*.  If you thought of every random event as shattering the
world into pieces, you could decide how to behave by simply counting
how many resulting worlds had the property you wanted to achieve.  But
one question remained.

"Master," he called to the old man's retreating back.  "I still have
not comprehended the third parable."

His master waved vaguely over his shoulder as he walked.  "A lesson
for another time.  You lack the tools to truly understand.  We will
return to the final parable next year, when you have comprehended the
first mystery of Hamming."

And with that, he was gone, disappearing into the forest as easily as
he had arrived.

Everett sat for a moment, collecting himself.  His head felt stuffy,
like someone had been cramming cotton balls up his nose.  But he set
his jaw.  He wiped the last drops of vomit with his sleeve, and picked
up a tablet.

The first mystery of Hamming could go stuff itself.  Armed with the
nature of the universe, he could figure it out on his own.
